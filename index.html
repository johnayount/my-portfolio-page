            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi there! I'm John and I love to code. I have not been coding for a long time and I did not start in this industry. 
            Working in the field of computer programming is very exciting and I cannot wait to begin.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently work full time in the Automotive industry and have since I graduated college in 2014. The world of cars is 
            also fun and very complex, I hope to one day return to this industry but on the programming side.
            <br>
            <br>
            My wife and I have one daughter and another on the way, we love to go to the park together and go hiking.
            Oh, and we have one very overweight cat named Minnie, how could I forget!
